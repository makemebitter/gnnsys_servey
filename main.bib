abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to ½ everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {The vertex-centric programming model is an established computational paradigm recently incorporated into distributed processing frameworks to address challenges in large-scale graph processing. Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to “think like a vertex” (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.},
